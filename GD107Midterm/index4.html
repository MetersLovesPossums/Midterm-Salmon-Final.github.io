        When its time for salmon to breed, they begin their trek back to the stream where they themselves were born. During this trek, they change from silvery, stremlined fish into brightly colored, lumpier fish, an image more commonly associated with stareotypical salmon. When they make it back to their birthplace, they breed as quickly as they can, before dying soon after, restarting the life sycle of a salmon leaving only their children behind.
