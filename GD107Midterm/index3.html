        Adult salmon live out most of their lives in the ocean. Depending on the species, their time there can last anywhere from six to seven years. In this time they feed on zooplankton, crab, shrimp, and smaller fish. When it is time to return to their original stream, the group up in large schools and begin their journey back.
